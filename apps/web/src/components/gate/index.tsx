/**
 * Client-side edition seam.
 *
 * Surfaces that only exist in the hosted product — team workspaces, billing,
 * the managed builders — are reached through this module so that consumers
 * never branch on the edition themselves. `./impl`, `./providers` and
 * `./popups` are the edition-specific files; this list of exports is the
 * contract both editions satisfy.
 *
 * Client-safe exports only. `CloudProviders` reaches a server-only module, so
 * it is imported from `./providers` directly by the server components that
 * use it — re-exporting it here would drag that module into every client
 * bundle that touches the gate.
