 * Trims bulky content out of *older* turns before a chat request is sent.

 * so a single web search (~15KB) or PDF ingestion preview (up to 50k chars) was
 * re-sent at full price on every later turn of the thread. This strips that
 * weight from turns the model has already acted on, while leaving the recent
 * turns - the ones a follow-up question is actually about - untouched.
 *
 * Applies to the model payload only. The persisted transcript and the UI are
 * unaffected, so nothing the user can see is lost.
 *
 * Must stay deterministic: the same history has to produce the same bytes on
 * every request, or the prompt cache is invalidated each time.
