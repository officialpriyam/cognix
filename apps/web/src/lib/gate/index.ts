/**
 * Billing and entitlement seam.
 *
 * Every metered or entitlement-gated code path goes through this module rather
 * than importing a billing provider directly. `./impl` is the only
 * edition-specific file: the cloud edition delegates to Autumn, the community
 * edition no-ops. Keep this re-export list — and the types behind it — stable,
 * because both implementations must satisfy it.
