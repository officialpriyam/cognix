/**
 * Superlog / OpenTelemetry configuration — single source of truth.
 *
 * Superlog ingests OTLP traces, logs, and metrics, groups noisy signals into
 * incidents, and (once the GitHub App is installed on the repo) opens draft PRs
 * for issues it judges severe. Everything the exporters need lives here so that
 * swapping Superlog Cloud for a self-hosted EU intake is a one-line change.
 *
 * ## Token model
 *
 * Superlog issues two token formats and they are *not* equally safe:
 *
 * - `sl_public_…` — project-scoped and write-only. It cannot read data or
 *   change settings, so it is safe in source, at the same trust level as a
 *   PostHog project token or a Sentry DSN. Superlog's own guidance is to inline
 *   it rather than route it through an env var, so a missing env var cannot
 *   silently break ingest on deploy.
 * - `superlog_live_…` — the older project format. Treat it as a **secret**:
 *   env var only, never committed, and never behind a `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix
 *   (which would ship it to every browser).
 *
 * Both are accepted so a project that was issued the older format works without
 * waiting on a reissue. `SUPERLOG_PUBLIC_TOKEN` is the override either way, so
 * the token can also be rotated without a redeploy.
 *
 * Until a real token is set, {@link isSuperlogConfigured} is false and the
 * bootstrap skips exporter registration entirely — no ingest attempts, no 401
 * spam, no behavioural change to the app.
